#🖥️ Computer Gadgets - Simple Product Showcase
📌 About This Project
Hey there! 👋 This is a Computer Gadgets web page that displays a list of 10 computer-related products. It’s a basic e-commerce-like setup where users can browse products, see their prices, and check the available stock.

The cool part? 💡 The prices and stock update dynamically based on a Google Form submission. This makes it easy for the store owner (that’s you! 😎) to update product details without editing the code manually.

🚀 What’s Inside?
✅ Product Listings
Each product has an image, name, price, and stock availability.
The UI is clean and easy to navigate.
🔍 Search & Sort
Search bar to quickly find products by name.
Sorting options to arrange items based on price.
🛒 Shopping Cart (Basic)
Users can add items to the cart.
Items can be removed from the cart.
A simple checkout button (just for show, no real payments yet!).
🔄 Dynamic Data Update
Prices & stock change dynamically based on data submitted via Google Forms.
No need to edit the HTML manually! Just update the form, and the page refreshes with new details.

🏗️ Tech Used
HTML → For the page structure
CSS → For the styling & responsiveness
JavaScript → To handle search, sort, cart, and dynamic updates

Here are some features I might add in the future:
✅ A proper checkout system with payments
✅ User reviews & ratings for products
✅ A real backend database instead of a Google Form
✅ More categories of gadgets
