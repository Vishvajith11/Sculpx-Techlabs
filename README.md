# Computer Gadgets - Simple Product Showcase  

## About This Project  

This is a **Computer Gadgets** web page that displays a list of 20 computer-related products. It is designed as a basic e-commerce-like platform where users can browse products, check prices, and view stock availability.  

The key feature of this project is that **prices and stock update dynamically** based on a Google Form submission. This allows the store owner to update product details without manually editing the code.
